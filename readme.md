# Project: Recursion

There are two assignments here: [`fibonacci.js`](fibonacci.js) and [`mergeSort.js`](mergeSort.js).

1. The first one writes two functions `fibs` and `fibsRec` to generate an array of `n` **fibonacci** numbers using **iteration** and **recursion** respectively.
2. The second one is a function to sort an array using the **merge sort algorithm**.

## Packages used

- `nodemon`
- `jest`

This assignments were a part of The Odin Project. Look at the [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) here.
